 o start the process I made a very basic rectangle then added the neccesary additions. I knew that I would need a a photo of the radar so i started with that because it would take up the most space. I moved on to formatting the photo. After it was formatted I made the boxes to input the username and password. I watched a few tutorials and asked John and Brad like twenty different times on how they got theirs to change colors. We eventually figured it out. I added the links and they would not seperate. I got them to seperate and turn green and now I cannot get them to go back to green. I am unsure if the cursor actually works, I was able to get it to appear a few times and havent seen it again. I worked on validating the username and password requirements. You came by and helped John Carter with this and I listened in and followed your directions though i think I missed a part because I can only get it to turn red on the email part but not the password.
